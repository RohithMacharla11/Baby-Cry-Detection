## About the Project


**Baby Cry Detection** is a deep learning-driven initiative aimed at monitoring and interpreting baby cries in real time by analyzing audio patterns to help caregivers understand infants' needs. It focuses on leveraging the Dunstan Baby Language model to differentiate five core cry types:  
- **"Neh"** – Hunger  
- **"Eh"** – Upper wind (burp)  
- **"Eairh"** – Lower wind (gas)  
- **"Heh"** – Discomfort (temperature or wetness)  
- **"Owh"** – Sleepiness  

Based on the repository, it appears the primary implementation resides in a Jupyter Notebook (`BabyCryDetection.ipynb`), likely containing data exploration and proof-of-concept model development.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Classification**: Utilizes audio signal processing and neural networks to categorize cry types.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Designed for real-time monitoring to promptly alert caregivers.
- **Extendable Design**: Code is modular and ripe for integration with hardware and apps.

## Technical Overview
| Component       | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**       | Audio samples of baby crying                                 |
| **Preprocessing** | Signal processing: extracting features like spectrograms or MFCCs |
| **Model**       | Deep learning architecture tailored for classification tasks |
| **Output**      | Cry-type prediction (e.g., *Hunger*, *Gas*, *Sleepiness*)    |
| **Demo Notebook** | `BabyCryDetection.ipynb`—demonstrates data ingestion, training, evaluation, and inference pipeline |

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohithMacharla11/Baby-Cry-Detection.git
   cd Baby-Cry-Detection
   ```

2. **Launch the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook BabyCryDetection.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the notebook to**:
   - Load and preprocess audio data
   - Train or load a pre-trained cry classification model
   - Evaluate performance metrics and test predictions

*(Future guidance for mobile or hardware components can be added under Setup once available.)*

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Months 1–3)
- Finalize dataset collection and labeling
- Experiment with audio feature extraction techniques
- Train and validate deep learning model prototypes
- Begin basic hardware sensor prototyping (e.g., sensor-embedded cloth)

### Phase 2 (Months 4–5)
- Design and develop the mobile app (Android) for real-time alerting
- Integrate hardware-software workflow for seamless detection
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback for improvements
